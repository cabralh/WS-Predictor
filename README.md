### Description
This document tracks the progress of the project and gives an overview what how the prediction algorithm came into fruition. It uses Lahman's Baseball Database as the source dataset.

The World Series in Baseball marks the end of the season. Two teams, one from the American and National League battle it out in a best of seven series. First to four games takes the win. 

Being an avid Baseball fan, I always wondered if there were any prevalent features or characteristics that the top winning teams shared. This project aims to find that.
